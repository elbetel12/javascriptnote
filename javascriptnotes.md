# java script

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. It is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming styles. Its syntax is C-like, influenced by C, C++, Java, and Objective-C, with additional features influenced by Scheme. JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and CSS.

JavaScript is used to create interactive web pages. It can be used to add animations, games, and other interactive elements to web pages. JavaScript can also be used to create server-side applications.

JavaScript is a powerful language that can be used to create a wide variety of applications. It is a popular language for web development, but it can also be used for mobile development, game development, and server-side development.

Here are some of the features of JavaScript:

- Object-oriented programming: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming, which allows you to create objects that contain data and methods.
- Procedural programming: JavaScript also supports procedural programming, which allows you to write code in a more traditional, linear fashion.
- Functional programming: JavaScript supports functional programming, which allows you to write code that is more declarative and reusable.
- First-class functions: JavaScript functions are first-class objects, which means that they can be passed around as variables and stored in data structures.
- Event-driven programming: JavaScript is an event-driven language, which means that it is designed to respond to events such as mouse clicks, keyboard input, and network requests.

Here are some examples of JavaScript codes:

**Code snippet**

```
// This code will print "Hello, world!" to the console.
console.log("Hello, world!");

// This code will create a new variable called "name" and assign it the value "John Doe".
var name = "John Doe";

// This code will get the value of the "name" variable and print it to the console.
console.log(name);

// This code will create a new function called "myFunction".
function myFunction() {
  // This code will print "Hello, world!" to the console.
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// This code will call the "myFunction" function.
myFunction();

// This code will create a new array called "numbers" and add the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to it.
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// This code will get the length of the "numbers" array and print it to the console.
console.log(numbers.length);

// This code will iterate through the "numbers" array and print each number to the console.
for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}

```

## Variable Operators in JavaScript

In JavaScript, there are several variable operators that can be used to modify or reassign the values of variables. These operators include:

- `=`: assigns a new value to a variable
- `+=`: adds a value to a variable and assigns the result
- `=`: subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result
- `=`: multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result
- `/=`: divides a variable by a value and assigns the result
- `%=`: takes the remainder of dividing a variable by a value and assigns the result

These operators can be used to perform arithmetic operations on variables, as well as to update the values of variables based on their current value.

## Data Types in JavaScript

In JavaScript, there are several data types that can be used to represent different kinds of values. These data types include:

- Number: used to represent numeric values, such as `42` or `3.14`
- String: used to represent textual values, such as `"Hello, world!"` or `'Goodbye, cruel world!'`
- Boolean: used to represent true/false values, such as `true` or `false`
- Null: used to represent the absence of any object value, often explicitly set when a variable or object property has no value or points to a non-existent object
- Undefined: used to represent the absence of any defined value, often used when a variable or object property has been declared but not yet assigned a value
- Object: used to represent complex data structures, such as arrays, functions, and objects
- Symbol: introduced in ECMAScript 6, used to create unique identifiers that can be used as object keys

Understanding these data types is important for working with JavaScript variables and objects.

**JavaScript has two types of data types: primitive and non-primitive.**

- **Primitive data types** are the basic data types of JavaScript. They are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they have been created. The primitive data types are:
    - Number
    - String
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
    - Symbol
- **Non-primitive data types** are objects. Objects are mutable, meaning that they can be changed after they have been created. The non-primitive data type is:
    - Object

Here are some examples of primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript:

- **Primitive data types:**
    - `var num = 10;`
    - `var str = "Hello, world!";`
    - `var bool = true;`
    - `var null = null;`
    - `var undefined = undefined;`
    - `var sym = Symbol("my-symbol");`
- **Non-primitive data types:**
    - `var obj = { "name": "John Doe", "age": 30 };`

Here are some of the differences between primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript:

- **Immutability:** Primitive data types are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they have been created. Non-primitive data types are mutable, meaning that they can be changed after they have been created.
- **Storage:** Primitive data types are stored by value, while non-primitive data types are stored by reference. This means that when you create a primitive data type, the value of the data type is stored directly in the variable. When you create a non-primitive data type, the reference to the object is stored in the variable.
- **Operators:** Primitive data types can be used with the primitive operators, such as the `+` operator for addition and the `` operator for multiplication. Non-primitive data types can be used with the object operators, such as the `.` operator for accessing properties.

## **java script data structures**

JavaScript has a variety of data structures that can be used to store and organize data. Some of the most common data structures in JavaScript include:

- **Arrays:** Arrays are a collection of elements that are stored in a contiguous block of memory. Arrays are indexed, meaning that each element can be accessed by its index. **For example**, you could use an array to store the names of all the students in a class.
- **Objects:** Objects are a collection of key-value pairs. Keys are strings, and values can be any type of data. Objects are not indexed, but they can be accessed by their keys .**For example**, you could use an object to store the user's preferences, such as their favorite color and their favorite food.
- **Hash tables:** Hash tables are a type of associative array that uses a hash function to map keys to values. Hash tables are very efficient for accessing elements by their keys. **For example**, you could use a hash table to store the names of all the cities in a country.
- **Linked lists:** Linked lists are a type of data structure that consists of a series of nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. Linked lists are very efficient for inserting and deleting elements from the middle of the list. **For example**, you could use a linked list to store the history of all the pages that a user has visited on a website.
- **Stacks:** Stacks are a type of data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added to the top of the stack and removed from the top of the stack. Stacks are very efficient for storing data that needs to be processed in a LIFO order. **For example, you could use a stack to store the instructions that need to be executed in a program.**
- **Queues:** Queues are a type of data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front of the queue. Queues are very efficient for storing data that needs to be processed in a FIFO order. **For example**, you could use a queue to store the requests that need to be processed by a server.

The data structure that you choose to use will depend on the specific needs of your application. For example, if you need to store a large number of elements that need to be accessed by their keys, then you might want to use a hash table. If you need to insert and delete elements from the middle of a list, then you might want to use a linked list.

## ***java script loops***

JavaScript supports four types of loops:

- **For loop:** The for loop is the most common type of loop in JavaScript. It is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. The syntax for a for loop is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // block of code
}

```

- **While loop:** The while loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is met. The syntax for a while loop is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
while (condition) {
  // block of code
}

```

- **Do-while loop:** The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the block of code is executed at least once, even if the condition is false. The syntax for a do-while loop is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
do {
  // block of code
} while (condition);

```

- **For-in loop:** The for-in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. The syntax for a for-in loop is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
for (var property in object) {
  // do something with property
}

```

Here is an example of a for loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10:

**Code snippet**

```
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

```

Here is an example of a while loop that counts down from 10 to 0:

**Code snippet**

```
var i = 10;
while (i > 0) {
  console.log(i);
  i--;
}

```

Here is an example of a do-while loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, even if the user presses `Ctrl`+`C` to exit the program:

**Code snippet**

```
var i = 1;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (true);

```

Here is an example of a for-in loop that prints the names of all the properties of an object:

**Code snippet**

```
var object = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

for (var property in object) {
  console.log(property);
}

```

## **java script functions**

A JavaScript function is a block of code that is designed to perform a particular task. Functions are used to organize code, make code reusable, and improve readability.

To define a function in JavaScript, you use the `function` keyword. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // code to be executed
}

```

The `functionName` is the name of the function. The `parameter1`, `parameter2`, and so on are the parameters of the function. The `code to be executed` is the body of the function.

To call a function, you use the function name followed by a set of parentheses. The parentheses can contain the arguments to the function. The syntax for calling a function is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
functionName(argument1, argument2, ...)

```

The `argument1`, `argument2`, and so on are the arguments to the function. If the function does not have any parameters, then you do not need to include the parentheses.

Here is an example of a JavaScript function that defines a function called `greet()`:

**Code snippet**

```
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

```

To call this function, you would use the following code:

**Code snippet**

```
greet("Bard");

```

This would output the following to the console:

**Code snippet**

```
Hello, Bard!

```

Functions can be nested, which means that a function can be defined inside another function. Nested functions can access the variables of the outer function.

Functions can also be used to create closures. A closure is a function that has access to the variables of the outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Functions are a powerful tool in JavaScript. They can be used to organize code, make code reusable, and improve readability.

## Window methods

The window object is the global object in JavaScript. It represents the browser window in which the script is running. The window object has a number of methods that can be used to control the browser window, such as opening new windows, closing windows, moving windows, and resizing windows.

Here is a list of some of the most commonly used window methods:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| alert() | Displays an alert box with the specified message. |
| confirm() | Displays a confirmation box with the specified message and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the user clicked OK or Cancel. |
| prompt() | Displays a prompt box with the specified message and returns a string value containing the user's input. |
| open() | Opens a new window with the specified URL. |
| close() | Closes the current window. |
| moveTo() | Moves the current window to the specified coordinates. |
| resizeTo() | Resizes the current window to the specified size. |

Here is an example of how to use the alert() method to display an alert box:

**Code snippet**

```
window.alert("Hello, world!");

```

Here is an example of how to use the confirm() method to display a confirmation box:

**Code snippet**

```
var answer = window.confirm("Do you want to close the window?");

if (answer) {
  window.close();
}

```

Here is an example of how to use the prompt() method to display a prompt box:

**Code snippet**

```
var name = window.prompt("What is your name?");

console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");

```

Here is an example of how to use the open() method to open a new window:

**Code snippet**

```
window.open("https://www.google.com", "newWindow", "width=500,height=300");

```

Here is an example of how to use the close() method to close the current window:

**Code snippet**

```
window.close();

```

Here is an example of how to use the moveTo() method to move the current window to the specified coordinates:

**Code snippet**

```
window.moveTo(100, 100);

```

Here is an example of how to use the resizeTo() method to resize the current window to the specified size:

**Code snippet**

```
window.resizeTo(500, 300);

```

 here are some examples of how to use the window methods in JavaScript:

// Display an alert box with the specified message.
window .alert("Hello, world!");

// Display a confirmation box with the specified message and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the user clicked OK or Cancel.
var answer = window .confirm("Do you want to close the window?");

if (answer) {
window .close();
}

// Display a prompt box with the specified message and returns a string value containing the user's input.
var name = window .prompt("What is your name?");

console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");

// Open a new window with the specified URL.
window.open("[https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com/)", "newWindow", "width=500,height=300");

// Close the current window.
window .close();

// Move the current window to the specified coordinates.
window.moveTo(100, 100);

// Resize the current window to the specified size.
window.resizeTo(500, 300);

## **java script class and objects**

A JavaScript class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is a collection of data and methods. Classes are used to organize code, make code reusable, and improve readability.

To define a class in JavaScript, you use the `class` keyword. The syntax for defining a class is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
class ClassName {
  // properties and methods
}

```

The `ClassName` is the name of the class. The `properties and methods` are the properties and methods of the class.

To create an object from a class, you use the `new` keyword. The syntax for creating an object from a class is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
var objectName = new ClassName();

```

The `objectName` is the name of the object. The `ClassName` is the name of the class.

Here is an example of a JavaScript class that defines a class called `Person`:

**Code snippet**

```
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name + "!");
  }
}

```

To create an object from this class, you would use the following code:

**Code snippet**

```
var person = new Person("Bard");

```

This would create an object called `person`. The `person` object would have a property called `name` with the value `Bard`. The `person` object would also have a method called `sayHello()`.

To call the `sayHello()` method, you would use the following code:

**Code snippet**

```
person.sayHello();

```

This would output the following to the console:

**Code snippet**

```
Hello, Bard!

```

Classes can be nested, which means that a class can be defined inside another class. Nested classes can access the properties and methods of the outer class.

Classes can also be used to create inheritance. Inheritance is a way of creating new classes from existing classes. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class.

Classes are a powerful tool in JavaScript. They can be used to organize code, make code reusable, and improve readability.

java script methods

A JavaScript method is a function that is stored as a property of an object. Methods are used to perform actions on objects.

To define a method in JavaScript, you use the `function` keyword. The syntax for defining a method is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
object.methodName = function(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // code to be executed
};

```

The `object` is the object that the method is defined on. The `methodName` is the name of the method. The `parameter1`, `parameter2`, and so on are the parameters of the method. The `code to be executed` is the body of the method.

To call a method, you use the dot notation. The syntax for calling a method is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
object.methodName(argument1, argument2, ...)

```

The `argument1`, `argument2`, and so on are the arguments to the method. If the method does not have any parameters, then you do not need to include the parentheses.

Here is an example of a JavaScript object that defines a method called `greet()`:

**Code snippet**

```
var person = {
  name: "Bard",
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name + "!");
  }
};

```

To call the `greet()` method, you would use the following code:

**Code snippet**

```
person.greet();

```

This would output the following to the console:

**Code snippet**

```
Hello, Bard!

```

Methods can be nested, which means that a method can be defined inside another method. Nested methods can access the variables of the outer method.

Methods can also be used to create closures. A closure is a function that has access to the variables of the outer method, even after the outer method has finished executing.

Methods are a powerful tool in JavaScript. They can be used to organize code, make code reusable, and improve readability.

## **conditional statements**

Conditional statements in JavaScript are used to control the flow of execution of a program. They allow you to execute different code depending on the value of a condition.

There are three types of conditional statements in JavaScript:

- **If statement:** The if statement is the most basic conditional statement. It allows you to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
- **Else statement:** The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false.
- **Else if statement:** The else if statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false, but another condition is true.

The syntax for an if statement is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
}

```

The `condition` is a Boolean expression that can be evaluated to true or false. If the condition is true, then the block of code inside the curly braces will be executed. If the condition is false, then the block of code will be skipped.

The syntax for an else statement is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition is false
}

```

The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false.

The syntax for an else if statement is as follows:

**Code snippet**

```
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false
}

```

The `else if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true, but another condition is false.

Here is an example of an if statement:

**Code snippet**

```
var age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult!");
}

```

This code will print the following to the console:

**Code snippet**

```
You are an adult!

```

Here is an example of an else statement:

**Code snippet**

```
var age = 17;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult!");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor!");
}

```

This code will print the following to the console:

**Code snippet**

```
You are a minor!

```

Here is an example of an else if statement:

**Code snippet**

```
var age = 17;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult!");
} else if (age >= 16) {
  console.log("You are a teenager!");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor!");
}

```

This code will print the following to the console:

**Code snippet**

```
You are a teenager!

```

Conditional statements are a powerful tool in JavaScript. They can be used to control the flow of execution of a program and to make your code more readable.

## Date object in JavaScript:

The Date object is a built-in object in JavaScript that represents a single moment in time. It has a number of properties and methods that can be used to get and set the date and time, as well as to perform calculations on dates and times.

Here is a list of some of the most commonly used Date object properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| year | The year in four digits. |
| month | The month in two digits, starting with 0 for January. |
| day | The day of the month in two digits. |
| hours | The hour in two digits, 24-hour format. |
| minutes | The minutes in two digits. |
| seconds | The seconds in two digits. |
| milliseconds | The milliseconds in three digits. |

Here is a list of some of the most commonly used Date object methods:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| getDate() | Gets the day of the month. |
| getMonth() | Gets the month in numeric form. |
| getFullYear() | Gets the year in numeric form. |
| getHours() | Gets the hour in numeric form. |
| getMinutes() | Gets the minutes in numeric form. |
| getSeconds() | Gets the seconds in numeric form. |
| getMilliseconds() | Gets the milliseconds in numeric form. |
| setTime() | Sets the time using milliseconds since the epoch. |
| setDate() | Sets the day of the month. |
| setMonth() | Sets the month in numeric form. |
| setFullYear() | Sets the year in numeric form. |
| setHours() | Sets the hour in numeric form. |
| setMinutes() | Sets the minutes in numeric form. |
| setSeconds() | Sets the seconds in numeric form. |
| setMilliseconds() | Sets the milliseconds in numeric form. |
| toDateString() | Returns a string representation of the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". |
| toLocaleDateString() | Returns a string representation of the date in the format specified by the user's locale. |
| toLocaleTimeString() | Returns a string representation of the time in the format specified by the user's locale. |
| toLocaleString() | Returns a string representation of the date and time in the format specified by the user's locale. |
| toUTCString() | Returns a string representation of the date and time in UTC format. |
| valueOf() | Returns the number of milliseconds since the epoch. |

Here is an example of how to create a Date object:

**Code snippet**

```
var date = new Date();

```

This will create a new Date object that represents the current date and time.

Here is an example of how to get the year from a Date object:

**Code snippet**

```
var year = date.getFullYear();

```

This will get the year from the Date object and store it in the variable `year`.

Here is an example of how to set the year on a Date object:

**Code snippet**

```
date.setFullYear(2023);

```
